# Lab 13 — Solution Selection Matrix, Benchmarking, and FMEA

**DMAIC phase:** IMPROVE  |  **Lab type:** Elective  |  **Course:** Certified Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt (CLSSYB) Training (TGS-2025053922)

> **Elective lab.** Complete this lab if time allows during class, or afterwards as additional practice. It extends the same Contoso Service Desk scenario used by the core labs.

## Objective

Evaluate and de-risk candidate solutions before implementation (A5, K2).

## Scenario

Contoso Service Desk handles employee IT requests. Employees complain that tickets take too long to be assigned, that they must keep chasing for status, and that agents apply different definitions of what counts as "resolved". You are supporting the improvement team as a Yellow Belt.

**The data.** Two weeks of ticket data have been collected: **400 tickets**, of which **96 contained at least one defect**, with **120 defects** recorded in total across **6 defect opportunities per ticket**. Mean assignment time is **55 minutes** against a **30-minute** improvement goal. The files in this lab's `data/` folder are that extract.

## What you will build

A scored solution selection matrix, a benchmarking summary and an FMEA with RPN.

**Tools and techniques:** Solution selection matrix, benchmarking, FMEA, RPN scoring

## Files in this lab folder

**`data/` — the mock data you analyse:**

- [`data/candidate-solutions.csv`](data/candidate-solutions.csv) — 5 rows · columns: solution_id, candidate_solution, est_cost, est_effort_days

**`templates/` — the worksheets you fill in:**

- [`templates/fmea.csv`](templates/fmea.csv) — columns: process_step, failure_mode, effect, cause, severity_1_10, occurrence_1_10, detection_1_10, RPN, action
- [`templates/solution-selection-matrix.csv`](templates/solution-selection-matrix.csv) — columns: solution, impact_w5, cost_w3, ease_w2, weighted_score, rank

Open the CSV files in Excel, LibreOffice Calc or Google Sheets. Work on a copy so the originals stay clean for revision.

## Steps

### Step 1

Agree the selection criteria and weight each by importance.

### Step 2

Score every candidate solution against the weighted criteria and rank the results.

### Step 3

Benchmark your process against an internal or external reference and note the gap.

### Step 4

Build an FMEA: failure mode, effect, cause, then score Severity, Occurrence and Detection.

### Step 5

Calculate RPN = S x O x D and address the highest-RPN failure modes first.

## Check your work

Your matrix ranks solutions by weighted score, and every FMEA row has an RPN and an action for the highest scores.

## Deliverable

Save your output — it forms part of your Contoso improvement package and is your revision material for the assessment.
